                <h1 class="growth-title">Part-Time Assistant of Information Systems Laboratory</h1>
                <p>As a part-time assistant, I gained extensive experience in operating and creating SQL databases using the ORACLE APEX (Application Express) platform. I taught 30 students across a total of 11 offline sessions. This role required me to think critically when addressing students' challenges, communicate the material clearly and accurately, and review and correct students' assignments.</p>

                <h1 class="growth-title">SASC Scholarship Mentor</h1>
                <p>I served as a mentor for two consecutive semesters, providing guidance to one mentee in the odd semester and two mentees in the even semester. My primary responsibility was to support students who had not met the required academic criteria or who were required to retake courses. This role allowed me to develop the ability to adapt my mentoring approach to diverse individual needs, offering personalized support for each mentee. In recognition of my contributions, I was awarded a 16 SKS tuition fee discount by SASC.</p>
